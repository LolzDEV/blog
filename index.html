    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>Hello there! I'm Lorenzo Torres and I'm a 16 years old amateur programmer, I currently live in Italy and I'm really interested in motorbikes, tech in general and physics. I decided to create this website so that I can share my daily adventures in the world of tech (or maybe also something else) with anyone who has interest in the subject.</p>
    <h3>About the website</h3>
    <p>As you have probably noticed the website is not so visually appealing, that's a choice: modern web development requires lot of effort and the result is often not so good in terms of performance, indeed I choose to just use plain html+css and only few javascript is really needed (code highlight for example). Also, I want this to look good in text based browsers like <b>links</b>.</p>
    <h3>Links</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/LolzDEV">GitHub</a></li>
        <li><a>IRC (Coming Soon)</a></li>
